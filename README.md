# Description

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/trescube/HowMany_node.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a programmatic solution to the problem:

`This sentence contains _ 0's, _ 1's, _ 2's, _ 3's, _ 4's, _ 5's, _ 6's, _ 7's, _ 8's, and _ 9's.`

I'm positive that the solution(s) implemented are not the most efficient and aren't intended to be.  Instead, these projects are ways for me to experiment with various language features, constructs, and testing tools.  

## Functional Node

The solution in [howmany_filter_and_reduce](src/howmany_filter_and_reduce) uses functional javascript with `filter` and `map`.  

## Functional Node w/Generator

The solution in [howmany_filter_and_reduce](src/howmany_filter_and_reduce) uses functional javascript with `filter` and `map` but using a generator instead of a for loop for iteration.
